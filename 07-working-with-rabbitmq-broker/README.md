# Getting started with RabbitMQ

In this workshop we will learn the basics of working with [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/). Make sure that you have created the environment as described in [Preparing the Environment](../01-environment/01-environment.md).

The main units of interest in RabbitMQ are queues, topics and messages.

In this workshop you will learn how to use and work with Queues and Topics and send and consume messages to/from both of them.
